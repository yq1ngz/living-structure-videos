Why are spiral shells so mesmerizing?
Why do butterfly wings look so perfectly shaped?
The answer lies in a shared trait of nature and human design—good shape.

A good shape isn’t just about looking nice.

A large good shape must be made of smaller good shapes.
Each smaller shape is also built from even smaller good shapes.
And the number of small centers must far exceed the large ones.

In Persian carpets, petals and leaves are built from tiny geometric forms.
Each is complete on its own, yet works together to form a rich, unified whole.

Good shapes have clear symmetry and balanced proportions.
Even the surrounding positive space is part of the overall design.

A Japanese teapot stand is a good shape.
Its parts are all good shapes themselves.
Even the space beneath the lip of the stand is a center that strengthens the whole.

In Romania, carved wooden columns work with the space around them to form a powerful structure.

In contrast, bad shapes feel loose, broken, and disconnected.
Futuristic chairs with no clear centers or structure can't be broken into meaningful parts.
Their components float without relation.

The secret to creating good shapes is simple:
Start with basic forms.
Make sure every level has its own good shape.
Each layer should be distinct yet work in harmony.
And always have far more small centers than large ones.

From the golden spiral of a nautilus shell to the domes of ancient cathedrals,
every good shape tells the same story—
true vitality comes from recursive order and harmony in the whole.
