What is beauty?
Building on the theory of living structure,
Professor Bin Jiang introduced a new, measurable concept of beauty: structural beauty.

He proposed a simple formula to quantify the “degree of livingness” in a structure:
L = S × H, where:
L stands for structural beauty,
S is the number of substructures,
H is the number of hierarchical levels.

Using the head/tail breaks,
an image or spatial pattern can be recursively broken down into nested substructures,
and the formula is applied to compute its degree of livingness.

The richer and more layered the structure,
the higher the L value—
and the more beautiful it feels.

This idea was inspired by the first of Christopher Alexander’s 15 geometric properties: Levels of Scale.
This property is essential—
without it, most of the others cannot emerge.
It is the foundation of a living structure.

Through studies of images and spatial forms,
it was found that structures with high structural beauty
often follow two natural laws:

Scaling law –
small sub-structures greatly outnumber large ones.

Tobler’s law –
structures at similar levels tend to resemble one another.

These patterns not only explain the beauty of nature,
but also why traditional architecture and classic patterns resonate so deeply.

Structural beauty has been applied in areas such as urban spatial analysis,
image aesthetics,
and architectural style comparison,
and it offers a theoretical foundation for AI-based visual perception of structure.

It transforms beauty from a subjective feeling
into a measurable, observable, and reproducible structural order.
