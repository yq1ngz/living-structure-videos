Why do tree roots stay firmly entwined with the earth for centuries?
Why do isolated skyscrapers often feel out of place?
The answer lies in a principle called non-separateness.

Non-separateness means seamless connection with the surroundings—
keeping one's own character while deeply linking to the world around.

It’s one of the most important of the fifteen properties.
Through blurred edges, smooth transitions, and deep resonance,
a thing becomes part of a greater whole—
like roots living in symbiosis with soil.

Look at this path—
the gravel fades naturally into the earth,
with no harsh division.
This is non-separateness in action.

The Giant Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi’an blends humbly with its surroundings,
yet never loses its quiet beauty.
It proves that real beauty doesn’t need to stand out—
it just needs to belong.

In art, Gauguin blurred the lines between humans and nature with color gradients.
Separation is only on the surface—
everything is connected at its core.

Non-separateness is more than an aesthetic rule—
it’s a truth of nature.
From tree roots to quantum entanglement,
science shows us: isolation is an illusion—
connection is the reality.

What is cut off becomes stiff.
What blends with its environment gains life.
This is the shared wisdom of ecology, psychology, and the universe.

Non-separateness teaches us:
beauty doesn’t come from standing alone,
but from dancing together.

It’s not about losing individuality—
it’s about deep connection.
Because true vitality comes from being part of the whole.
