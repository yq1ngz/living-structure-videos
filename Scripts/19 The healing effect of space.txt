Why do we so often feel relaxed in nature?
Is nature truly healing us?

In fact, there’s a well-developed body of science behind that feeling.

Biologist Edward Wilson proposed that our affinity for nature is an instinct rooted in evolution.

This is known as the Biophilia Hypothesis.

For much of human history, we lived closely with natural environments, so we developed an innate preference and emotional attachment to natural elements.

But that’s not the whole story.

Psychologists Rachel and Stephen Kaplan found that nature can help restore our attention.

When we focus for long periods, the brain becomes fatigued.
Attention, like a battery, can be drained.

But in nature, the gentle movement of leaves and shifting light
offers “soft fascination,” a kind of effortless attention that allows the mind to recover.

Some effects of nature go even deeper, reaching into the body itself.

Architect Roger Ulrich compared post-surgery recovery among hospital patients.
He found that those with a view of trees recovered faster, used less pain medication, and had more stable moods.

This very study was later cited in a public hearing on the site of a proposed nuclear power plant—where people used it to defend a forest as a source of healing.

Together, these theories show us that nature doesn’t just feel good, it actively shapes our cognition, emotions, and even physical recovery.

And they lead us to a deeper question: What kind of space can truly nourish the human spirit?

Architect Christopher Alexander proposed
that such spaces often share a quality he called “living structure.”

It’s not about simply adding plants or natural elements.
It’s about an organic spatial order that grows like a living organism with strong centers, thick boundaries, and repeating rhythms that come together as a coherent whole.

Nature is only the beginning.
What truly heals us is the sense of living order embedded in the spaces we inhabit.
