Why do crack patterns on porcelain divide so evenly?
Why do Roman streets fit together like living cells?
The answer lies in a quality called convex spaces.

A convex space grows outward from the inside, like a corn kernel,
until it fits tightly with its neighbors.

Nature has long mastered this:
Soap bubbles expand from inner pressure, forming flat, clean edges.
Cracked porcelain splits along stress lines, with each piece compact and clear.
The secret?
No vague leftovers. Every unit is a strong center.

How can humans learn from this?

Roman streets and plazas meet like crystals,
each space clear, complete, and reinforcing the others.

A Japanese tea bowl flows in harmony with the air around it—
its space as beautiful as its form.

In failed designs, like some modern buildings,
spaces are broken and scattered, losing their energy.

In Matisse’s cut-outs, figures and backgrounds interlock,
echoing how natural systems interact.

This reveals the rule of convex spaces:
Every space must have a clear shape, a distinct function,
and a dynamic connection to neighboring spaces.

Anatolian carpets show interlocking positive and negative shapes.
Mughal reliefs fill even the tiniest gaps between leaves with energy.
Italian arcades feel alive because their forms are clear and whole.

But when convex space is lost—like in some of Louis Kahn’s buildings—
what remains is fragmented and lifeless.
It becomes meaningless leftover space.

Convex space is a timeless design key.
It lets cold stone and flowing air move together in rhythm.
Its power lies in respecting every inch of space.
