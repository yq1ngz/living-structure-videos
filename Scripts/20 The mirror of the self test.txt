If you had to choose one object to represent yourself,

which one would it be?

It may sound like a psychological test,

but the “Mirror of the Self” test

was created by architect Christopher Alexander

to explore how people sense livingness in things—

and how that connects to their deeper self.

When we face a building, an object, even a pattern—

we often feel an unexpected pull.

Not because it’s pretty.

Not because it’s expensive.

But because it feels like me.

Alexander believed this feeling

helps us recognize what has life, wholeness,

and also living structure.

Each time, the experiment is a choice between two things.

No words, no logic—

just a quiet question:

“Which one feels more like myself?”

Between a gray metal stool and a blue wooden bench,

almost everyone chose the bench.

Likewise, though the ketchup bottle looks more modern,

over 80% of people said the salt shaker

felt quieter, gentler—more like themselves.

It might sound like personal taste.

But Alexander found

that people from different cultures, genders, and backgrounds

often chose the same thing.

Because we’re not really saying, “I like this.”

We’re saying, “This feels like who I truly am.”

“This is who I hope to become.”

In these choices,

we glimpse our wholeness,

humanity,

honesty—

and vulnerability.
