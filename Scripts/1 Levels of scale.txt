Have you ever wondered why some things feel full of life, while others seem dull and lifeless?

Like how Matisse’s paintings feel vibrant, but a concrete wall feels flat.

Traditional Irish doors have charm, but some modern ones feel bland.

The secret lies in the 15 fundamental properties proposed by Christopher Alexander in *The Nature of Order*.

One of them is **Levels of Scale**.

This means that a thing or system has many “centers” at different sizes.

These centers are connected, with clear size jumps, and they support each other—creating a sense of life.

According to the rule of scale, smaller centers should far outnumber larger ones.

Together, they form a layered structure that feels alive.

Take Matisse’s painting as an example:

The body is a large center.

The back area is medium.

The head, hat, and flowers are smaller.

The petals and lace details are even smaller.

All these levels work together to create a vibrant composition.

Compare that to a concrete wall and a Tōrō (Japanese lantern).

The size gap between the wall and its bolts is about 2000:1—too big to relate.

But the Tōrō has gradual size jumps: body, head, legs, hooves—around 2:1.

Each scale supports the others, creating harmony and life.

Now look at the Irish door:

Its panels, frame, and handle are all different in size, forming rich layers.

A modern flat door, with evenly sized parts, lacks these levels—so it feels lifeless.

As we've seen, having ordered levels of scale matters.

Small and large centers must reinforce each other to create a whole that’s greater than the sum of its parts.
