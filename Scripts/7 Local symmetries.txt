Why is every snowflake unique, yet perfectly ordered?
Why do mosque tiles seem chaotic, yet keep us fascinated?
The answer lies in a feature called local symmetry.

Local symmetry means small symmetrical elements scattered throughout a structure.
They overlap and interact in local areas, acting like glue—
bringing coherence and life to the whole.

In a snowflake, each branch splits again with symmetry.
This happens at multiple levels, creating a stable structure.

Humans use this too.

The Alhambra is not symmetrical overall,
but its details are filled with layers of local symmetry.
Even a single tile may contain overlapping symmetrical parts.

Amsterdam canal houses aren’t symmetrical as a row,
but each house and facade includes strong symmetric elements.
This subtle order flows through the entire street.

Alexander’s experiments show that the more local symmetry a pattern has,
the easier it is to perceive and remember.

Unlike global symmetry,
which often feels rigid and lifeless,
local symmetry creates complexity with balance.

Detroit’s Renaissance Center is strictly symmetrical,
but feels cold and exaggerated.
The Zeppelin assembly hall is so simplified,
its symmetry comes off as childish or harsh.

From a snowflake to a palace,
local symmetry makes complex systems stable yet flexible.
It’s a kind of wisdom mechanical symmetry can never match.
