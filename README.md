# 📽️ Living Structure Video Narratives

This repository contains 20 English-language narration scripts based on Christopher Alexander’s theory of *Living Structure*, as explained in *The Nature of Order* and extended by Bin Jiang’s structural beauty theory.

🎥 These short-form educational videos are published via the WeChat Channel of the LivableCityLAB.

## 🔍 About the Series

Each video explains one of the following key concepts:

- The 15 fundamental geometric properties
- The concept of structural beauty (L = S × H)
- Recursive livingness and its perception
- The healing effects of space
- The Mirror of the Self Test

Together, they form a coherent educational supplement to the study of urban aesthetics, human-centered design, and perceptual wholeness.
